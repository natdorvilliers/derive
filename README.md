## Site 1
https://www.nct2018.com/

-I got to this website by looking for my fellow kpop bois.
-The design is very trendy and current. What makes it feel this way is all the thumbnails of the videos moving abnd the way the typ is set up. 
- The navigation system is easy.Its very familiar and just an up down scroll and the info bar at the top nothing too extravagant or fancy. 
- Most of the website is interactive if you click the boxes you get sent to a youtube link of the music videos.
- I really think that the site is aesthetically pleasing and its pretty. It may not be useful to everyone but it is to me.
- Something I would change about this website is maybe the layout of the video, so they all fit in a specifically measured box instead of mismatched.

## Site 2
http://theofficestaremachine.com/

- I randomly stumbled upon this website while looking for websites 
- The design is,,,,,,,,,,, SAD. Literally no thought process to this and that's okay. 
- There is barely a navigation system, there is nowhere to navigate and that's that pretty much. 
- The part of the website that are interactive is the part where you type in an emotion and click the start the button other than that that's all there is to it.
- It kind of has a sketchy website feel to it and that's basically its purpose.
- I would probably change the type on the website but other than that i think everyhting on the website suits the content.

## Site 3
https://bigassmessage.com/#

- again randomly stumbled upon.
- The design is like an 8-bit feel to it until you preview your messages, then most of them is pretty basic.
- The navigation website is basic no much navigating to do.
- Again most of the website is interactive, once you write your message you can click on the "theme" of the message and you can click on the preview button to see how it looks like when you finally save the link and send it to someone. 
- I really like the feel to the website. Its definetly does the job of sending a big message.
- I wouldnt change about this website i like it the way it is :). Maybe i would put a warning sign when you click the magic theme because its pulsing colours.

## Site 4
https://johansson.design/KawsColorByNumbers/

- I got here by clicking on the last link on there corner and i scrolled though someone's design portfolio i guess.
- The design is super minimalistic, its not a lot but its effective. The fact that everything is in black and white before oyu color everything in is what makes it feel that way.
- The navigation system is pretty self explanatory there isn't much to it exactly.
- The website is interactive when you click on the boxes and colour it in with the mini colour boxes on the botton when you click an image.
- This website is definetly not useful in any way but very interesting.
-There isn't anything i would do to change the site because it doesn't need a lot to serve its purpose as a coloring in website.

## Site 5
http://tholman.com/texter/

- browsing the internet for weird websites and i found this 
- The design there actually isnt much to it as previous website more like efficient placing.
- There isn't a really a navigation system because its only one page. 
- The interactive part of the website is the little box in the corner where you can change what how oyu want your text to appear when drawing something.
- You get to draw stuff with text what's not useful about this. This website should be used for typography projects. :)
- The thing I would change about this website is maybe add more fonts that you can draw with.
